# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Steven Ov

The secret of good writing is to keep every sentence to its cleanest component. It is very simple for us to keep our sentences clutter free, we just have to make sure our thinking process is not cluttered in our heads. When we write we have to be careful and think of the reader because we are trying to convey to the reader not ourselves. It is good to go over your writing more than once and reading it aloud because we tend to find that our writing is more cluttered then we thought at the moment of writing. Writing is hard and it usually is not the readers fault if they don’t understand the writing, it is usually the writers fault. Cleaning clutter is laborious it is pushing out words that don’t need to be there. I found it interesting that the book stated that "Clutter" is the official language used by corporations to hide their mistakes" because it true that they use words to do this. When writing we have to be careful to not use fancy words where there are simple words to get the same idea across. To sum up everything I read into 3 words, I would say Simplify, Simplify, and Simplify.
